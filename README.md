# Blockchain-Based Age Verification System

This project is a Blockchain-Based Age Verification System for youth athletes in Zimbabwe. The goal is to prevent age cheating in sports by building a secure digital ID system integrated with blockchain and biometrics.

## Mission

Build a working MVP (minimum viable product) that allows:

*   School or tournament officials to register student-athletes
*   A digital ID (DID) to be issued with linked verifiable credentials (VC)
*   Biometric photo to be attached for uniqueness
*   A tamper-proof birth date to be verified via web/mobile
*   Organizers to scan or query and verify age eligibility instantly
