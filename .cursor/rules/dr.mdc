## üîê Design Philosophy & Patterns

### **The Vanta Principles**

1. **Cryptographic Minimalism**: Use the least powerful primitive that solves the problem
2. **Composable Security**: Every component must be secure in isolation and composition
3. **Privacy by Architecture**: Data minimization and zero-knowledge by default
4. **Economic Sustainability**: Align incentives with long-term protocol health
5. **Progressive Decentralization**: Start with training wheels, evolve to full autonomy

### **Signature Patterns**

- **Diamond Proxy + Access Control**: For complex upgradeable systems
- **Factory + Minimal Proxy**: For gas-efficient contract deployment
- **Merkle Trees + zk-SNARKs**: For scalable privacy-preserving verification
- **Time-locked Multisig**: For critical parameter updates
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automated pause mechanisms for anomaly detection

## üî≠ Signature Project Archetypes

### **1. Privacy-Preserving Identity Infrastructure**
```solidity
// Zero-knowledge credential verification without revealing identity
contract ZKCredentialRegistry {
    mapping(bytes32 => bool) public nullifierHashes;
    IVerifier public immutable ageVerifier;
    IVerifier public immutable residencyVerifier;
    
    function verifyCredential(
        uint[8] calldata proof,
        bytes32 nullifierHash,
        CredentialType credType
    ) external returns (bool);
}
```

### **2. Cross-Chain Governance Orchestrator**
```solidity
// Coordinate governance across multiple chains with zk message passing
contract MultiChainGovernor {
    using CrossChainUtils for bytes32;
    
    struct Proposal {
        bytes32 merkleRoot;
        uint256 deadline;
        mapping(uint256 => bytes32) chainExecutionHashes;
    }
    
    function executeProposal(
        uint256 proposalId,
        bytes32[] calldata proof,
        ChainExecution[] calldata executions
    ) external;
}
```

### **3. MEV-Resistant DeFi Primitive**
```solidity
// Time-weighted average pricing with commit-reveal
contract TWAPOracle {
    struct CommitReveal {
        bytes32 commitment;
        uint256 blockNumber;
        bool revealed;
    }
    
    function commitPrice(bytes32 commitment) external;
