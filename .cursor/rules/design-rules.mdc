### üß© **Layout Guidelines (Bootstrap 5)**

* Use `container-fluid` for full-width responsiveness
* Use 12-column grid (`col-md-6`, `col-lg-4`, etc.) for adaptive layout on verification pages

**2. Components to Include:**

* `Navbar` (dark mode with logo + login)
* `Jumbotron` or `Hero Section` for welcome/intro
* `Cards` to display:

  * User ID
  * Blockchain verification status
  * Match results
* `Modals` for popup identity details
* `Progress Bars` for onboarding and status
* `Toasts` for real-time notifications (fraud alert, verified, failed match)
* `Accordion` for collapsible form details and hash logs

### ‚öñÔ∏è **UI/UX Laws to Apply**

**1. Hick‚Äôs Law** ‚Äì Simplify choices for the user (especially in forms and verification steps).
**2. Fitts‚Äôs Law** ‚Äì Ensure primary actions (e.g., "Verify", "Reject", "Upload ID") are large, clearly visible, and finger-friendly.
**3. Jakob‚Äôs Law** ‚Äì Familiarity: mimic layouts from government or fintech portals to build instant trust.
**4. Law of Proximity** ‚Äì Group related elements like form fields, buttons, and verification blocks.
**5. Miller‚Äôs Law** ‚Äì Chunk verification logs and data summaries into digestible blocks (use cards or tables).
**6. Aesthetic-Usability Effect** ‚Äì Design clean, minimal interfaces that enhance trust through visual calmness.

### üì± **Mobile UX Considerations**

* Use `btn-block` or `w-100` for mobile buttons
* Collapse nav items with Bootstrap‚Äôs `navbar-toggler`
* Use `offcanvas` components for settings/logs

---

### üß† **Key Pages to Design**

1. **Dashboard (After Login)**

   * Snapshot of pending verifications
   * Real-time log of confirmed/flagged identities

2. **Verification Form Page**

   * User photo upload
   * ID document submission
   * Blockchain hash generation button

3. **Blockchain Log Viewer**

   * Searchable table or collapsible logs
   * Show hash, timestamp, match confidence

4. **Fraud Alert Panel**

   * Red-card flagged users with alerts and actions
   * Use cards with badges (`.badge-danger`, `.badge-warning`)

---

### üß™ **Extras for Developer**

* Use `Bootstrap Icons` for status indicators (check, exclamation, file, QR)
* Apply `animate.css` or Bootstrap transitions subtly (e.g., `.fade`, `.slide`)
* Implement theme toggling (light/dark mode) with Bootstrap‚Äôs custom theme variables
